# Language Learning App (Java)

This is a **Language Learning App** developed using Java that helps users learn and practice new languages through interactive lessons, quizzes, and vocabulary exercises. The app is designed to assist beginners and advanced learners in mastering various aspects of a language, including vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and sentence structure.

## Features

- **Multi-language support**: Allows users to learn multiple languages.
- **Interactive lessons**: Breaks down lessons into manageable chunks (vocabulary, phrases, etc.).
- **Quizzes**: Tests users on vocabulary and grammar.
- **Daily challenges**: Motivates users to practice daily to improve their skills.
- **User progress tracking**: Tracks user progress and performance in each lesson.
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use interface for better user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher installed.
- An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **Visual Studio Code**.
- Optional: For GUI (if implemented), **JavaFX** or **Swing** libraries installed.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the app on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-learning-app-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd language-learning-app-java
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac LanguageLearningApp.java
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   java LanguageLearningApp
   ```

If the app uses a GUI framework (e.g., JavaFX or Swing), make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for proper UI rendering.

## How It Works

1. **User Login/Sign-Up**: Users can create an account or sign in to track their progress.
2. **Choose Language**: Users can select the language they want to learn (e.g., Spanish, French, German).
3. **Lessons**: The app presents lessons based on the selected language, including vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation exercises.
4. **Quizzes**: After each lesson, users can take quizzes to test their knowledge.
5. **Progress Tracking**: The app stores user data to track progress and suggest lessons based on proficiency.

## Example Usage

**Example flow in the app**:
1. User starts the app and creates an account.
2. The user selects the language they want to learn.
3. The app presents a lesson on basic vocabulary.
4. After the lesson, the user completes a quiz to reinforce learning.
5. The app tracks progress and suggests next lessons.

## API (Optional)

If you plan to implement API features for this app, you might create endpoints like:

- `POST /login` - User login.
- `POST /signup` - User registration.
- `GET /lessons/{language}` - Retrieves lessons for the selected language.
- `GET /quiz/{language}` - Retrieves quizzes based on the user's language choice.

## Testing

You can use **JUnit** or any other testing framework for unit testing to ensure the core functionality works as expected. Make sure to test:

- Language selection
- Lesson progression
- Quiz functionality
- User login and data persistence
